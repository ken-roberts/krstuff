# ~/.krstuff/platform_etc.d

This directory is for .bash_profile snippets that are specific to the OS being run.

There's nothing really special about this directory. Create the files here, and then use
a symbolic link to put it into ~/.krstuff/bash_profiles.d so it can be sequenced the way
you want.
