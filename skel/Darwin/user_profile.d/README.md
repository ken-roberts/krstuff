# ~/.krstuff/user_profiles.d

This directory is for .bash_profile snippets that are custom to the user being logged in.

There's nothing really special about this directory. Create the files here, and then use
a symbolic link to put it into ~/.krstuff/bash_profiles.d so it can be sequenced the way
you want.
